Vendor-specific DICOM conventions, private tags, nested data, multilingual fields, and missing metadata make rule-based detectors unreliable. This project delivers a production-ready ML pipeline that automatically classifies 8 MR and 3 CT series using only DICOM header metadata. </p> <p>It features: 1. A robust feature-extraction module handling private/nested tags and multilingual headers. 2. Two HistGradientBoosting (HGBC) models\u2014trained with and without <code>SeriesDescription</code>\u2014to remain robust when textual labels are missing or inconsistent. 3. A self-inspection mechanism that flags low-confidence predictions to radiologists for review.</p> <p>Externally validated on partner-hospital datasets, the model achieved 96.69% MR and 99.25% CT accuracy, replacing the legacy C++ detector in production.
